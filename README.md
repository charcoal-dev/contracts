Charcoal Contracts is a lightweight library that defines the core interfaces and enums used across the Charcoal
ecosystem, setting clear behavioral contracts without binding to implementations. It provides stable abstractions for
modules to interoperate—such as standardized error codes, service contracts, or capability markers—ensuring consistency,
type safety, and minimal coupling across the framework.
